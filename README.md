# Pomodorust 🍅

A minimalist, powerful, terminal-based Pomodoro timer written in Rust to help you stay focused and productive.

## ✨ Features

- **Classic Pomodoro Workflow** — Cycle through focused work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks with configurable durations and a configurable long-break interval.
- **Task Management** — Create, rename, reorder, complete, and delete tasks. Assign tasks to projects using `@tag` syntax.
- **Task Notes** — Attach multi-line notes to any task. Edit with a full-screen modal editor (`Shift+E`).
- **Search & Filter** — Press `/` in any view to filter tasks by name, notes, or project tag in real time.
- **Statistics** — Weekly bar chart, daily and all-time summary, and a searchable list of completed tasks with per-task details (time focused, pomodoros, dates).
- **Four Color Themes** — Default, Dracula, Solarized, Nord. Switchable from the settings panel.
- **Desktop Notifications** — Native desktop notifications when a timer segment ends.
- **SQLite Persistence** — All tasks and app state are stored in a local SQLite database (`~/.local/share/pomodorust/pomodorust.db`). Settings persist separately as TOML (`~/.config/pomodorust/config.toml`).
- **Cross-Platform** — Runs on macOS and Linux.
